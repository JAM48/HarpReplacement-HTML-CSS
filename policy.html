      <p class="pmain podd"><em>(Amended  as of May 16, 2019)</em></p>
      <p class="pmain peven"><strong>PLEASE NOTE: OUR PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES  FROM TIME TO TIME. PLEASE CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES</strong></p>
      <p class="pmain podd">This  Web site is not directed at persons under the age of 18. No information collected from children is knowingly used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside of this website.  By registering on this  Site through the submission of the information requested, you agree that the  following terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy shall govern our use and  disclosure of your personal information. When you register with this website,  you explicitly authorize us to share your information. If you do not agree with  the terms and conditions of our Privacy Policy, please do not complete the  information request form (i.e., do not register) or otherwise use or access  this Site. If you have already registered by completing the information  disclosure forms, and you wish to opt-out from receiving more information from  us, <a href="http://www.sub-manage.com/o-zggb-v18-dfd9866963bf1a3f9dfc1695cf3fd901&amp;cr=187">please click on this link</a> to <strong>"Opt-out."</strong> Your e-mail address will be added to  the suppression files associated with this Site within ten (10) business days  of your request. Thereafter, you should not receive any email correspondence  from us. However you will still receive promotional communications from our  third party partners with whom we have shared your information. To stop  receiving further communications from these third parties you will need to  contact them directly in order to opt-out. Please note when you opt-out of  receiving promotional communications from us, we will no longer make your  information available to our third party partners.</p>
      <p class="pmain peven">This  Privacy Policy describes in some detail the information that we collect from  you as part of the normal operation of our service, and what may happen to the  information we collect.</p>
      <h4 class="h4main">Your privacy is very important to us</h4>
      <p class="pmain podd">We  understand that some of the information that you might provide on our Site is  personal and private. By submitting your personal information, you are  entrusting us to handle information that you regard as private, for the  purposes and in the manner set forth in this Privacy Policy. In exchange for  your trust, you expect us to handle your personal and private information in a  professional manner that will be in keeping with your trust. Our Privacy Policy  explains what information we obtain on this Site, and how we use the  information disclosed to us to link you to our business affiliates who have  expressed a willingness to provide you with the products and services  associated with this Site.</p>
      
      <h4 class="h4main">The Do Not Track browser settings</h4>
      <p class="pmain peven">Advertisers may collect data about your online browsing activity and use it to show you targeted ads (a process known as "behavioral advertising”).</p>
      <p class="pmain podd">You can prevent companies from showing you targeted ads by submitting opt-outs to those service providers.</p>
      <p class="pmain peven">Opting-out will only prevent targeted ads so you may continue to see generic (non-targeted ads) from these companies after you opt-out.</p>
      
      <h4 class="h4main">WE MAY USE INFORMATION THAT WE HAVE COLLECTED FOR ANY  LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE, INCLUDING SELLING OR TRANSFERING SUCH INFORMATION  AT ANY TIME TO THIRD PARTIES FOR ANY LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE PURPOSE.</h4>
      <p class="pmain podd">For  example, we may share your personal information with select business affiliates  so that they can contact you and offer you products and or services that we  believe might be of interest to you. This may include e-mail advertising,  telephone marketing, direct mail marketing, and online banner advertising to  name a few. In addition, we may maintain separate e-mail, mailing or phone  lists for different purposes based on the information that you submitted and  that we maintain. For your information, our business affiliates have all agreed  to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations relating  to the handling of your personal information. You may learn more about any of  our business affiliate's privacy policy by visiting our business affiliates'  Web sites at such times as such affiliate may contact you. We are not  responsible for the privacy practices or the content of our business  affiliates' Web sites. If you wish to end any e-mail correspondence from us,  you will need to Opt-out from receiving further correspondence by advising us  of your decision to Opt-out by clicking a link in the e-mail to our Opt-out  procedures. Within ten (10) business days, your e-mail address will be placed  on a suppression list and we will no longer correspond with you by email or  resell or transfer your information to third parties. If you wish to end future  correspondence with any of our business affiliates, you will need to follow the  instructions at the end of any such each e-mail message from them to  unsubscribe from such business affiliate's e-mail. You are able to opt-out when  registering with us.</p>
      <p class="pmain peven">We  may also disclose your personally identifiable information in response to a  subpoena, court order, or other legal process; as well as the transfer or sale  of personally identifiable information pursuant to the sale of our business or  assets. Should such a combination or acquisition occur, we will require that  the new combined or acquiring entity follow this privacy policy with respect to  your personal information. If we transfer ownership of the site to another  company, we will notify you by email or by general notice on our site. In  addition to the forgoing, we may also sell, transfer or share  non-individualized information, such as summary or aggregated anonymous  information about all persons or sub-groups of persons visiting this site.</p>
      <p class="pmain podd">We  cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal  information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this  Privacy Policy. For example, third parties may unlawfully intercept personal  data or access our servers and obtain personal data. Therefore, although we use  industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, nor you  should not expect, that your personal information would always remain private.</p>
      <p class="pmain peven">Certain  sensitive information such as credit card numbers or other information such as  social security numbers and drivers licenses ("Financial  Information") collected on the site and associated data is encrypted and  protected with SSL encryption software from the time it is captured by our  application to the time it is transmitted to our servers. For more information  on the encryption and protection of your information, please see How We Protect  Your Privacy.</p>
      <h4 class="h4main">Application of this Privacy Policy</h4>
      <p class="pmain podd">This  Privacy Policy applies to consumers that have signed up on the website. We may  sell the personal information that you supply to us and we may work with other  third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members  via direct mail, email and telemarketing. These businesses may include  providers of direct marketing services and applications, including lookup and  reference, data enhancement, suppression and validation and email marketing</p>
      
      <h4 class="h4main">How We Protect Your Privacy</h4>
      <p class="pmain peven">We  protect your privacy in a number of ways. As an initial matter, any Financial  Information transmitted to our servers via a secure server is encrypted using  SSL technology. SSL is a protocol that transmits your communications over the  Internet in an encrypted form. The protocol ensures that the information is sent,  unchanged, only to the server you intended to send it to.</p>
      <p class="pmain podd">Once  your information reaches our server, it is protected by a firewall. With a  firewall in place, your information is virtually inaccessible to third parties.  In addition to encryption and firewall protections, we have all of our business  affiliates agree to operate in accordance with federal and state laws and  regulations, including regulations relating to CAN-SPAM and rules promulgated  by the FTC. If we learn that any of our business affiliates are breaching our  agreement, and therefore your trust, we will take corrective actions  immediately or terminate our relationship with such business affiliate.</p>
      <p class="pmain peven">We  follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal  information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage,  is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially  acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its  absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site,  you can mail us at the address indicated below in the Contact Us section.</p>
      <h4 class="h4main">Changes; Opting-Out</h4>
      <p class="pmain podd">If  you want to change the information that you submitted, please do so by making  another request through our Site. We will not be able to change information  that is forwarded on to our business affiliates. Please contact the business  affiliates directly to change any of your information.</p>
      <p class="pmain peven">If  you want to request to be removed from further communication with this Site,  including our Premium Services, please Opt-out by <a href="http://www.sub-manage.com/o-zggb-v18-dfd9866963bf1a3f9dfc1695cf3fd901&amp;cr=187">clicking on this link</a> to our  Opt-out procedure. We will place your e-mail address on a suppression file  associated with this Site. Persons whose names appear on our suppression file,  will have their e-mail addresses checked against all correspondence to be sent  by us. Where there is a match, the planned email correspondence will be withheld,  and such person will receive no further email correspondence from us. Your  e-mail address will be placed on the suppression list associated with this Site  within ten business (10) days of your request. Once you have opted out, we will  no longer forward you email from this site but we are not responsible or in  control of the business practices of our business affiliates who have been  forwarded your information.</p>
      <h4 class="h4main">Notification of Changes to Privacy Policy</h4>
      <p class="pmain podd">We  may update this Privacy Policy at any time by posting a new privacy policy on  the Site. Be sure to check the current terms of any privacy policy in effect by  visiting this Site. By checking the effective date of the policy, you will be  immediately alerted on whether the Privacy Policy has been updated. Please note  however, that the updated privacy policy will go into effect automatically 30  days after initial posting. From time to time, we may use your information for  new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. Please  note that if our information practices change at some time in the future, we  will use only data collected from the time of the new privacy policy amendment  forward for those new purposes. If we make material changes to this policy, we  will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.</p>
